  "body": "### Introduction\r\nThis project is meant to be a comprehensive but simple autonomous RC car program running on a Raspberry Pi 3. It is written in C++ using modular implementation of the various steps involved in the working of a autonomous vehicle. \r\n\r\n### Implementation\r\nThere are three separate parts of the program that work with each other using a consistent communication procedure, thereby separating the effects of the specific implementation of a part on the others. The three parts are Parser (for parsing maps), Pathfinder (for finding the optimal path), Pilot (for sending time-based low level signals to the servos).",
